## 📚 What is *First EthicalAI*?

**First EthicalAI** is an open initiative to support the development and use of AI, by creating effective frameworks, policies and tools.   
We believe in open knowledge, collaborative writing, and inclusive practices.  

Everyone is welcome to contribute — whether it's writing, editing or reviewing.

## 📚 AI Foundations

We are building an open-source collection of frameworks, principles, and resources for ethical and responsible AI development.
Firstly, we are starting with some foundational aspects which will set the scene for our ongoing work.

Explore the key documents:

- [AI Purpose, Goals & Objectives](ai_purpose_goals_objectives.md)
- [AI Principles](ai_principles.md)
- [AI Lifecycle](ai_lifecycle.md)
- [AI Terminology](ai_terminology.md)
- [AI Standards and Guidelines](key_references.md)
- [AI Publications](key_publications.md)
  
_Our project welcomes international contributions, while initially starting with a focus on the UK context._
